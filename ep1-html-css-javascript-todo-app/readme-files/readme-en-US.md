# Simple To-Do List App

This is a simple to-do list application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to add, delete, edit, and mark tasks as complete.

## Features

- **Add tasks:** Users can add new tasks to the list by typing in the input field and clicking the "Add" button or pressing the "Enter" key.
- **Delete tasks:** Users can delete tasks from the list by clicking the "Delete" button next to the task.
- **Edit tasks:** Users can edit existing tasks by clicking the "Edit" button next to the task, modifying the text in the input field, and clicking "Save" or pressing "Enter".
- **Mark tasks as complete:** Users can mark tasks as complete by double-clicking on the task. This will strikethrough the task and make the text color lighter. Double-clicking again will mark the task as incomplete.
- **Input validation:** The application prevents adding empty tasks and provides alerts to the user.
